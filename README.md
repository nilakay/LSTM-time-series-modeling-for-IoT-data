# LSTM-time-series-modeling-for-IoT-data
Developed a deep-learning pipeline using LSTM networks to forecast time-series data from IoT sensors, demonstrating the applicability of recurrent neural networks to real-world asset-and-infrastructure monitoring. The project includes full preprocessing—from anomaly detection and feature engineering through data normalization—followed by model training, validation, and comparative analysis with MLP and Random Forest baselines. Visualizations of MAE, MAPE and error-distributions provide insight into model performance, while the notebook implementation showcases reproducible code and a modular architecture suitable for future integration in predictive-maintenance workflows.
